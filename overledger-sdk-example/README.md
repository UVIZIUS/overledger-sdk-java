There are some examples that can get you started with Overledger.

First make sure to get and set your own MappId and BPIKEY in the context.properties file.

<b>BasicSDKTestGetTransactions</b>
<p>
<li> The first example is BasicSDKTestGetTransactions where we read some overledger transactions</li>
<li> output some details from last transaction</li>
</p>
<b> SDKSendTransactions</b>
<p>
<li> We create two transactions on the Ripple and Ethereum networks.</li>
<li> We add our private key information to the SDK and sign locally</li>
<li> We get confirmation and an overledger ID that the transactions were broadcasted</li>
</p>
